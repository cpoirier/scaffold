# Philosophy

* Good software is custom software. Your framework should support you, not dictate 
  to you. The organization of code within a software system is the business of an
  intelligent programmer. There is no (appropriate) one-size-fits-all solution.
  
* The programmer should never be required to create a subclass when passing a Proc 
  will suffice. We have a good language: we should use it. To use a desktop programming 
  metaphor, wanting to open a window on the screen should not require you to become one.

* Simple things should be simple. Difficult things should be made less so.

* You website's URLs are part of your user interface. To the greatest extent possible, 
  they should be about your content, not your code. In other words, the structure of your 
  website should be dictated by your needs, not your framework. 

* Context is everything. Site organization is a business decision, not an application one. 
  Context from one level should inform and constrain the next. Your website software should 
  be able to understand and leverage context to produce a flexible and powerful user 
  experience.
