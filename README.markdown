# Philosophy

* Form defines and constrains function; function gives meaning to form. In good design, 
  the two cannot be separated.

* Simple things should be simple. Difficult things should be made less so.

* Good software is custom software.
  
  

# Practical concerns

* Site organization is a business decision, not simply an application one. Your framework 
  should support you, not dictate to you, in this respect. The organization of code within 
  a software system is the business of an intelligent programmer. There is no (appropriate) 
  one-size-fits-all solution.

* Your website's URLs are part of your user interface; they provide context to your 
  software and help define your conceptual model for your users. To the greatest extent
  possible, they should be about your content, not your code. 
  
* The structure of your website should be dictated by your needs, not your framework. Context 
  information should naturally flow through the system, so that your software can understand 
  and leverage it to provide a flexible and powerful user experience. 

* You should never be required to create a subclass when passing a Proc will suffice. We have 
  a good language: we should use it. To use a desktop programming metaphor, wanting to open 
  a window on the screen should not require you to become one.
