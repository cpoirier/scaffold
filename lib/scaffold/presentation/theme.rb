# Theme names must be process-unique, and 
# For conveniece, each new Theme is defined as current, so you can easily add items to it via

   # and existing name, you'll get an AssertionFailure for your trouble.
   #
   # Your theme should never assume URLs for its static resourcesâ€”they can be mapped at any 
   # location by the application. Instead, declare them when you create the theme (with paths
   # relative to the theme directory), and then lookup the actual URL in resource_urls at run 
   # time. Note that if you put your resources in folders, you need only declare the folder (it's 
   # more efficient at run-time). Applications can create the mappings in config.ru with a call 
   # to map_resources().
